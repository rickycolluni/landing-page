The Odin Project curriculum has tasked me with creating a landing page.

What could be improved:
1. This webpage was designed with only computer/laptop screen resolution in mind. Should have started to design from smallest view (smartphone).
2. Elements and tags are used liberally and can be semantically incorrect.
3. Usage of flexbox is very unruly.
